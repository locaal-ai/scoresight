2. In the OCR Training Data Settings:
   - Click the button to save data as a ZIP file
   - Choose a location to save the file
3. Send the exported ZIP file to our team at [support@scoresight.live](mailto:support@scoresight.live) for processing. We will be in touch with a new OCR model.

## Best Practices

1. Annotate regularly to maintain a manageable workload.
2. Use keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation and annotation.
3. Double-check your annotations before approving.
4. Use the filter option to focus on unapproved images when nearing completion.
5. Set a reasonable max size for saved data to prevent overwhelming file sizes.

By following this process, you'll contribute valuable training data to improve the OCR system's accuracy and performance. Thank you for your efforts in enhancing our OCR capabilities!
